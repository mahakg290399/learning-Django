This file will work as a NoteBook of whatever I learn during my Django Backend Developer learning course.

1. The Django comes with a admin page which helps you control the data,user and a lot of other things.
2. The request flow : the request comes to urls.py file to chek for the existing paths. then it goes to the function mentioned in views.py file and execute the code. from there the function return the template (Basically HTML files) that we have stored in the templates folder.
